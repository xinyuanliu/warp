//! The `TuiElement` trait — the unit of layout and paint — and the bridge that
//! lets a [`TuiView`](warpui_core::TuiView) render to a boxed element while the
//! shared core stores that output fully type-erased.
//!
//! The concrete elements (text, columns, styled containers, child-view,
//! key-event handler) are added by task 3.2; this module owns the *trait* they
//! implement and the *presentation context* they thread through during the
//! child-view recursion that the presenter (task 3.3) drives.

/// What a [`TuiView`](warpui_core::TuiView) renders to.
///
/// A view sets `type RenderOutput = TuiRenderOutput` and returns a boxed
/// element from `render_tui`. The shared core never names this type: it boxes
/// the value again into `Box<dyn Any>` (the abstract `TuiBackend::RenderOutput`),
/// which the presenter recovers by downcasting back to `Box<dyn TuiElement>`.
/// Because `TuiRenderOutput` is `'static`, it satisfies the core's
/// `TuiView::RenderOutput: 'static` bound, and that erasure is exactly what
/// keeps `warpui_core` free of any dependency on this crate.

/// FROZEN METHOD SET. Sibling tasks (3.2 elements, 3.3 presenter, 3.4 runtime)
/// build against exactly these methods:
/// - [`layout`](TuiElement::layout): measure against a [`TuiConstraint`],
///   returning a [`TuiSize`] within it (see [`TuiConstraint::clamp`]).
/// - [`render`](TuiElement::render): paint into `area` of `buffer`. `area` is
///   the rect the parent allocated (its size is the value `layout` returned,
///   clamped to what was available).
/// - [`desired_height`](TuiElement::desired_height): the height this element
///   wants at a given width, used by stacking containers before they have a
///   final height budget.
/// - [`cursor_position`](TuiElement::cursor_position): where a text cursor
///   should sit within `area`, if any (default: none).
/// - [`present`](TuiElement::present): participate in the child-view recursion
///   so the presenter can record parent/child view relationships (default:
///   nothing — only container/child-view elements override this).
/// - [`dispatch_event`](TuiElement::dispatch_event): offer an event to this
///   element, returning whether it was handled (default: not handled).
