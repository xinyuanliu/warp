//! Refresh orchestration for a connected xAI / Grok subscription's OAuth
//! tokens.
//!
//! The tokens themselves live in [`ApiKeyManager`] (the request-building
//! source of truth, persisted to secure storage under `GrokOAuthTokens`).
//! This module owns the network-facing refresh lifecycle — converting a
//! [`TokenResponse`] into stored [`GrokTokens`], proactively refreshing the
//! access token shortly before it expires, and rescheduling the next refresh.
//!
//! The Grok subscription is BYO auth, so background refresh follows the BYO
//! API key policy. That policy lives in the app layer (workspace settings),
//! which this crate has no visibility into; the app wires it in via
//! [`ApiKeyManager::set_grok_refresh_allowed`].
//!
//! The network/protocol side of the connect flow (authorize URL, loopback
//! callback server, token exchange/refresh) lives in the [`oauth`] submodule.
