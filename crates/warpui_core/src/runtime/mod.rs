//! The TUI runtime, additive behind the `tui` feature: the alternate-screen
//! lifecycle and the draw + event loop that drives a [`TuiView`] through the
//! shared [`App`].
//!
//! Placement: the GUI has no in-core analog of this module — its runtime is
//! the platform event loop in the `warpui` crate — so the TUI runtime stands
//! alone as an additive top-level module rather than a backend submodule of an
//! existing one.
//!
//! [`TuiRuntime`] mirrors the GUI's invalidate→redraw flow. On
//! [`enter`](TuiRuntime::enter) it puts the host terminal into raw mode + the
//! alternate screen (restored on drop) and subscribes to the window's
//! invalidation signal; [`run_until`](TuiRuntime::run_until) then repeatedly
//! redraws when dirty and polls crossterm for input, converting each event with
//! [`crossterm_event_to_tui_event`] and dispatching it — first through the
//! shared keymap (the focused view's responder chain, exactly like the GUI
//! window event path), then through the rendered element tree.
//!
//! The host terminal is abstracted behind [`TuiTerminal`] so the loop and the
//! frame renderer can be exercised headlessly against an in-memory writer
//! without a real tty. The concrete [`CrosstermTerminal`] is the production
//! implementation.
