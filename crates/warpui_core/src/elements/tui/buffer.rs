//! The styled cell grid the element tree paints into.
//!
//! This is ratatui's `Buffer` (re-exported as [`TuiBuffer`]) with `Style`
//! re-exported as [`TuiStyle`] and `Cell` re-exported for convenience. Elements
//! paint with the buffer's own grapheme-aware writers (`set_string`,
//! `cell_mut`, `set_style`); the diff/flush to the terminal is the ratatui
//! `Terminal`'s job, wired up by the runtime.
//!
//! [`TuiBufferExt::to_lines`] is the headless assertion hook used throughout the
//! element tests: it renders each row to a `String`, skipping the trailing
//! columns of wide graphemes so every glyph appears exactly once (mirroring how
//! ratatui's own `Buffer` debug output collapses multi-width cells).
