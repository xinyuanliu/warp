//! The TUI element library, additive behind the `tui` feature.
//!
//! [`TuiElement`] is the unit of layout and paint: what a
//! [`TuiView`](crate::TuiView) renders to. The library mirrors the GUI element
//! vocabulary at terminal-cell granularity:
//!
//! - [`geometry`]: integer cell-grid geometry ([`TuiSize`], [`TuiRect`],
//!   [`TuiConstraint`]).
//! - [`buffer`]: the in-memory styled cell grid ([`TuiBuffer`], [`Cell`],
//!   [`TuiStyle`]) elements paint into and the renderer flushes to the
//!   terminal.
//! - [`event`]: the dispatch-side event types ([`TuiEventContext`],
//!   [`TuiDispatchEventResult`], [`TuiEventDispatchResult`]) threaded through
//!   [`TuiElement::dispatch_event`]. (The crossterm → warp event *conversion*
//!   lives with the runtime, in `crate::runtime`.)
//! - The concrete elements: [`TuiText`], [`TuiColumn`], [`TuiContainer`],
//!   [`TuiChildView`], and [`TuiEventHandler`].
