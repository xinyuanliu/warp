//! TUI event-dispatch types.
//!
//! The TUI runtime (`crate::runtime`) converts raw crossterm events into the
//! shared [`Event`](crate::Event) vocabulary (so element/view dispatch is
//! identical to the GUI), then walks the rendered element tree handing each
//! element the event plus a [`TuiEventContext`] it can use to queue app
//! updates and typed actions back into the shared core.
//!
//! This module holds the dispatch-side types that are part of the
//! [`TuiElement`](super::TuiElement) contract; the crossterm → warp event
//! conversion lives with the runtime.
