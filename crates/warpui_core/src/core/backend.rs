//! The `Backend` marker trait and the bridges that let the shared application
//! core store and render backend-specific view objects without naming the
//! concrete view trait.
//!
//! This is the parameterization seam. [`AppContextImpl<B>`](super::AppContextImpl)
//! and [`Window<B>`](super::Window) are generic over `B: Backend`, and the
//! associated types below carry the pieces that differ between the GUI backend
//! (here, [`GuiBackend`]) and the TUI backend (added in a later milestone): the
//! type-erased per-window view object, a view's render output, and the
//! presentation layer.
