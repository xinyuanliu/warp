//! Background window activation without private SkyLight APIs.
//!
//! Background input (delivering clicks/keys to a window that is not frontmost, without moving
//! the real cursor) requires the target window to believe it is in the AppKit-active input
//! state. We achieve that the way a real first click on an inactive window would, but without
//! the visual side effect of bringing the app to the front:
//!
//! 1. Install per-process [`CGEvent`] event taps (`CGEventTapCreateForPid`) on both the
//!    previously-frontmost app and the target app. The taps run on a dedicated run-loop thread
//!    and drop the focus-change messages that macOS would otherwise deliver to the previous app
//!    to switch the user's frontmost application.
//! 2. Send an `appKitDefined` activation primer event (an `NSEvent` of type `AppKitDefined`,
//!    subtype `ApplicationActivated`) directly to the target process via `CGEventPostToPid`.
//! 3. Send a single "primer" left click to the exact center of the window. While the window is
//!    inactive, macOS routes this first click through its activation flow instead of firing a
//!    UI action, so it activates the window without otherwise affecting the app.
//!
//! State is tracked in a process-global registry keyed by `(pid, window)` rather than on the
//! per-action [`super::Actor`] (which is recreated for every computer-use turn). This lets a
//! single computer-use session activate a window once and reuse that activation across later
//! turns without re-sending the disruptive center click, and lets concurrent computer-use
//! sessions targeting different windows coexist while serializing each activation handshake
//! through the registry lock.
