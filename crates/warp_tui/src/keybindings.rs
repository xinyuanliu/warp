//! TUI keybinding registration and cross-surface validation.
//!
//! Mirrors the GUI convention: each TUI view module exposes a top-level
//! `init(app)` that registers its keybindings, aggregated here and called once
//! at TUI startup (from [`crate::session`]'s mount). Fixed bindings are
//! reserved keys (ctrl-c); editable bindings are named `tui:*` so they are
//! user-remappable by name via `keybindings.yaml` (loading overrides in the
//! TUI process is a follow-up — the names registered here are the stable
//! contract).
//!
//! # Cross-surface isolation
//! GUI bindings cannot fire in the TUI even though the TUI process registers
//! them all: predicate-scoped bindings never match TUI keymap contexts, and
//! even a predicate-less binding dispatches an action type that no TUI view
//! handles, so the keystroke falls through to the element pass unharmed. The
//! debug-time validators below enforce the remaining convention: any
//! *keystroke* binding that matches a TUI view's context must be TUI-owned.
//! This catches GUI bindings registered without a context predicate — which
//! would otherwise match everywhere and, for multi-keystroke chords, swallow
//! prefix keys via a pending match.
