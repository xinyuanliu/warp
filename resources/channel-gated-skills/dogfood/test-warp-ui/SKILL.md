# Computer Use for Warp UI Testing

Use the `computer_use` tool to visually test that Warp looks and behaves as intended after UI changes.

## Running Warp

Launch Warp from the repository root. The exact command depends on which environment variable holds the API key:

- If `WARP_API_KEY` is already set, omit the flag entirely — the `--api-key` flag is bound to `WARP_API_KEY`, so Warp reads it automatically:

  ```bash
  cargo run --bin warp
  ```

- If the key is in `STAGING_USER_WARP_API_KEY` instead, pass it explicitly via the flag:

  ```bash
  cargo run --bin warp -- --api-key $STAGING_USER_WARP_API_KEY
  ```

Always pass `--bin warp` explicitly. That target builds the internal (dogfood) channel, which is the only channel that honors `--api-key` for the GUI app. A plain `cargo run` builds the OSS channel, which ignores the key and falls back to interactive onboarding.

Authenticating this way starts the app directly without interactive login prompts.

Initial builds may take several minutes; subsequent incremental builds are faster.

## Testing Workflow

### 1. Hardcode or Mock Data (When Needed)

If you just need to verify that a specific UI looks correct, it can be useful to hardcode or mock data so the UI state is immediately reachable without navigating a full flow. This is optional — skip this step when testing end-to-end flows that should work naturally.

Examples of when to hardcode:

- **Conditional UI**: The feature only appears under certain conditions (e.g., a specific setting, a non-empty data set, an active subscription) — hardcode the condition so the UI always appears.
- **Feature flags**: The feature is behind a flag that isn't enabled yet — enable it directly.
- **Error states**: You want to test error handling UI — hardcode error responses or failure conditions.

Keep mocked changes minimal and focused — only change what's necessary to reach the UI state under test.

### 2. Invoke Computer Use

Call the `computer_use` tool with a task description that includes:

- The command to build and launch Warp from the repo root: `cargo run --bin warp` when `WARP_API_KEY` is set in the environment, or `cargo run --bin warp -- --api-key $STAGING_USER_WARP_API_KEY` when the key is in `STAGING_USER_WARP_API_KEY` instead
- Step-by-step instructions for navigating to the UI being tested
- **Specific observations to report**: describe exactly what elements, text, colors, layout, or states the tool should observe and describe back
- Do **not** include expected values in the task — the tool should report what it sees, not judge correctness

### 3. Verify Results

Compare the observations returned by `computer_use` against your expectations. If the UI doesn't match, investigate and adjust the code or mocks accordingly.

## Tips

- **Be specific in task descriptions**: Instead of "check if the dialog looks right," say "open Settings, click the General tab, and describe the text and layout of the first section."
- **Test one thing at a time**: Focused tests are easier to debug when observations don't match expectations.
- **Build before invoking**: Always confirm the build succeeds before calling `computer_use`. The tool cannot fix build errors.
